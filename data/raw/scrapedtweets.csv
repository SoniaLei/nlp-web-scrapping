1. On Monday, BlackRock downgraded US stocks from “overweight” to “neutral.”

2. Gary Shilling is very bearish on stock markets. He expects them to crash between 30% and 40% over the next year. 

3. If Biden becomes president and raises taxes that President Trump lowered, it could lead to upheaval and a possible crash in US stock markets.

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Greenlane Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company’s stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it.”

Stagwell Media has proposed a combination with MDC Partners (NASDAQ:MDCA) which would make the combined entity the 8th largest global marketing services company.

The proposal values MDC common shares at $4.25/share on a fully diluted basis and implies a premium of 263% to MDC’s closing price of $1.17/share on June 24.

Stagwell would receive 335.5M common shares of MDC.

The combination will strengthen MDC Partners’ balance sheet and credit profile.

The combined entity would have generated over $2B in net revenue in 2019.

For one thing the Fed is NOT buying $SPY, although it certainly feels manipulated so does every bear market rally throughout history. It's actually illegal for them to buy equity on the public market, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 not only explicitly prevents this but it's not even in their purview. They are a lender of last resort and they only have lending powers, not spending powers. What about all the money flooding into savings accounts? Well, roughly 80% of the entire country is living paycheck to paycheck, the vast majority of which are making far more through CARES then they were at their original job. The huge influx of savings is not only necessary for most Americans, but unemployment benefits end July 31st. This is also coming at a time when eviction protections are ending.

Since these markets are such a psychological game, it's important to have many different personalities under observation.. including your own!

I love the ability to follow people because everyone has something different to say, and if you pick just a handful of people and learn their psychology, it can help be yet another tool to help feel out the market and make trade decisions...

Might seem a little ""stalkerish"" but not at all. I just click ""follow"" on people that stand out to me, and before I know it, after reading lots of their posts, I start to develop an idea of the type of trader they are... and I take note of it all on the daily as part of my DD/daily analysis. 

@diagio is my dynamic thunderbird, he's smart and witty.. quick to drop a hot potato, ruthless, and will call you out for being a bad trader.

You have a clear ""Bullish Engulfing"" candle and now the price should come back and tap that $308 price imbalance to setup for a move higher next week. Simple as that. Sure they can sell next week's candle off on the back side of the ""bullish engulfing"" which is called a ""breaker block."" However, I think the more likely move is to confirm that the ""bullish engulfing"" is legit and go with what you're seeing rather than taking a contrarian viewpoint. But that said if they do sell next week's candle off then you'd want to watch that psychological $300 level. Period. Bears if they want to go lower they have to cleanly break through $300 again confirming a ""Bearish Engulfing."" Still too much Fed intervention I don't see it happening yet until SPY seeing ATHs.

Over the last week, SPOT has been consolidating after the large move but it isn’t finished yet. Today we closed above $274.30 and I’ll be looking for entry as this shows strength by holding the $274.30 level as support.
•
As long as SPOT stays above $274.30 on the daily chart, then this will push towards our two price targets.
•
1st Price Target: $285 🎯

2nd Price Target: $300 🎯",10/07/2020,06:46:31

Can’t begin to tell you how many negative comments were thrown out about “have fun buying a soda with those gains.” $1,500 was ALOT of money to me and my family.

Bounce off of the 1 hour 21 and continuation into the third hour of trading.  You can see how the current hourly candle wicked down and got bought up quickly.  That speaks to the strength of the buying right now.   The full range has already been played today as of this morning.  A break of 316 going into the weekend would be pretty bullish.

That's why biggest caps are doing best as well, they have been preparing 12 years for this.

The U.S. budget deficit in June was $863 billion.  For perspective, an annual budget deficit of $863 billion is enormously massive and fiscally unsustainable.  Yet, now, the U.S. government has racked up $863 billion in debt, in just one month. 
 
For additional perspective, the budget deficit for June 2019 was $8 billion.  Hence, the deficit for June 2020 has increased 101x compared to June of last year.  This, no doubt, is game over spending; desperate actions by a desperate government to keep this sucker from going down. 
 
Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, for clarification of what’s at stake: “There’s a risk that the dollar starts to reverse into a significant downtrend because the value of the dollar versus other currencies is greatly affected by the growth in our budget and trade deficit.”

At least most Chinese will tell you to their face they think anyone other than Chinese is inferior to them and China gonna rule the world.

Global Fascist Left is most racist.  Telling black people/ ""Minorities"" they need special help to succeed is as racist as it gets.  All the while creating modern day plantations of single mothers and desolate atmosphere where kids are manipulated into believing they have no future because of the Republicans that have never had any say on any policies in their cities.

Should yield curve control go global, it would cement markets’ perception of central banks as the buyers of last resort, boosting risk appetite, lowering volatility and intensifying a broader hunt for yield. While money managers caution that such an environment could fuel reckless investment already stoked by a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, they nonetheless see benefits rippling across credit, equities, gold and emerging markets.

“It depends on the form and the price but broadly speaking it’s the green light to carry on with the QE trade -- buy everything regardless of valuation,” said James Athey, who manages $3.1 billion at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London.

So long as you’re trading intraday the nearest expiration option or maybe the next to nearest expiration option you have the ability to swing that contract for well over 100%+ / per Day. I want to put up a chart illustrating how at certain times of the day if you entered a particular option and yes lately it has been calls shortly after the 9:30-10:30am dip and ride those calls throughout the mid portion of the cash session you could capture 100%+ gains in a single trading session. That is how you can turn a SMALL account into $25000+ in a relatively short amount of time. Now, personally I have strict rules to my trading in terms of risk/reward, stops, and profit targets. I typically will risk SPY $0.50 or -10% on my option to make 20-40%. So my risk / reward ratios are always 1 : 2 or 1 : 4.

Berkshire H pulled out very similar to cash in Sept 2008. Hmmm.  Pretty convenient 6 months before March 2009 bottom.  What have they done in 2020.  I've listened to media call them out for missing this bull market April and May 2020. I dont expect it to last.  6 months early is a good wakeup call.

2. profit taking on tech side before earnings start (earnings starting Tues with banks)
3. algo's reset the technical indicators for the whole market (make it looks like there was an 'oversold' condition on the pullback to allow new highs)
4. Fed start another round of buying (drive down yields, increasing some rotation to safety from profit taking with bonds backed by fed - everyone wants to keep some of the money they've made)
5 . The wall of options expiring at $310 (nearly 350k+ contracts of puts and calls) - MM's price pinning

The initial theorem was that this was an accumulation cycle with a retouch on top of the breakout and turns out we were right.

Nothing shows this better than the daily. With a clear breakout from the chop and a retouch of 3105 which was top of the breakout where new demand would have to be for this to keep going, ES looks as bullish as ever. The 3180 level and of course the 3230 above are clear targets however should ES push through I don’t think either one of those levels have enough selling interest leftover to stop it. On a pullback some obvious levels to watch out for are 3150 area and 3130 area on a pullback. Until 3230 gets taken out this is still a higher low so do keep that in mind as well.

Meanwhile, if you really support BLM, check out: 1) MLK (the man), and 2) GLYC (trials with 94.5% black representation, 91% institutional ownership, sub $175M market cap, and pipeline including 2 phase 3 drugs... one of which apparently just proved statistical significance).

Another member of the coronavirus task force, Admiral Brett Giroir, added to the Fauci pile-on today when he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Fauci has not always been correct.

“I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100 percent right and he also doesn’t necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,” Giroir said.

“The economic implications of the second wave are pretty clear, qualitatively at least. The third quarter recovery will be slower than we previous expected, but we're hoping that some of the deferred spending will be pushed into the fourth quarter rather than abandoned altogether,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.

“Markets are caught in the middle. We have argued for months that a full recovery depends on three pillars, namely, sustained progress against the virus, the continuance of super-accommodative Fed policy, and consistent support from fiscal policy,” he added. “Clearly, the first pillar has crumbled, and the third is now in limbo, with the Senate in recess until July 20.

L1_Trading,/L1_Trading/message/227183448,Bullish,"$SPY bears think because cases go up, death rate goes up. The most closely watched indicator during this virus is the death rate. Not the overall cases. Cases are going up and death rate is going down. This is a POSITIVE development. Also we will be getting vaccine news all week out of Russia and most likely out of the U.S also. Still haven’t gotten the point across yet? Well how about all the earnings being posted this week. Everyone will outperform a pathetic guidance and Wall Street will cheer it on. When banks lose 30% YTD it will be a massive buying opportunity because they didn’t lose 50% .... I believe the bears got their chance to pounce in March and I strongly believe that this will never go under 300.00 again, especially once this virus passes.

“Wait. I can catch Covid twice?” my 50-year-old patient asked in disbelief. It was the beginning of July, and he had just tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, for a second time — three months after a previous infection. 
 
While there’s still much we don’t understand about immunity to this new illness, a small but growing number of cases like his suggest the answer is “yes.” 
 
Covid-19 may also be much worse the second time around. During his first infection, my patient experienced a mild cough and sore throat. His second infection, in contrast, was marked by a high fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, resulting in multiple trips to the hospital.
