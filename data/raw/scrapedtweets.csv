1. On Monday, BlackRock downgraded US stocks from “overweight” to “neutral.”

2. Gary Shilling is very bearish on stock markets. He expects them to crash between 30% and 40% over the next year. 

3. If Biden becomes president and raises taxes that President Trump lowered, it could lead to upheaval and a possible crash in US stock markets.

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Greenlane Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company’s stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it.”

Stagwell Media has proposed a combination with MDC Partners (NASDAQ:MDCA) which would make the combined entity the 8th largest global marketing services company.

The proposal values MDC common shares at $4.25/share on a fully diluted basis and implies a premium of 263% to MDC’s closing price of $1.17/share on June 24.

Stagwell would receive 335.5M common shares of MDC.

The combination will strengthen MDC Partners’ balance sheet and credit profile.

The combined entity would have generated over $2B in net revenue in 2019.

For one thing the Fed is NOT buying $SPY, although it certainly feels manipulated so does every bear market rally throughout history. It's actually illegal for them to buy equity on the public market, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 not only explicitly prevents this but it's not even in their purview. They are a lender of last resort and they only have lending powers, not spending powers. What about all the money flooding into savings accounts? Well, roughly 80% of the entire country is living paycheck to paycheck, the vast majority of which are making far more through CARES then they were at their original job. The huge influx of savings is not only necessary for most Americans, but unemployment benefits end July 31st. This is also coming at a time when eviction protections are ending.

Since these markets are such a psychological game, it's important to have many different personalities under observation.. including your own!

I love the ability to follow people because everyone has something different to say, and if you pick just a handful of people and learn their psychology, it can help be yet another tool to help feel out the market and make trade decisions...

Might seem a little ""stalkerish"" but not at all. I just click ""follow"" on people that stand out to me, and before I know it, after reading lots of their posts, I start to develop an idea of the type of trader they are... and I take note of it all on the daily as part of my DD/daily analysis. 

@diagio is my dynamic thunderbird, he's smart and witty.. quick to drop a hot potato, ruthless, and will call you out for being a bad trader.

You have a clear ""Bullish Engulfing"" candle and now the price should come back and tap that $308 price imbalance to setup for a move higher next week. Simple as that. Sure they can sell next week's candle off on the back side of the ""bullish engulfing"" which is called a ""breaker block."" However, I think the more likely move is to confirm that the ""bullish engulfing"" is legit and go with what you're seeing rather than taking a contrarian viewpoint. But that said if they do sell next week's candle off then you'd want to watch that psychological $300 level. Period. Bears if they want to go lower they have to cleanly break through $300 again confirming a ""Bearish Engulfing."" Still too much Fed intervention I don't see it happening yet until SPY seeing ATHs.

Over the last week, SPOT has been consolidating after the large move but it isn’t finished yet. Today we closed above $274.30 and I’ll be looking for entry as this shows strength by holding the $274.30 level as support.
•
As long as SPOT stays above $274.30 on the daily chart, then this will push towards our two price targets.
•
1st Price Target: $285 🎯

2nd Price Target: $300 🎯",10/07/2020,06:46:31

Can’t begin to tell you how many negative comments were thrown out about “have fun buying a soda with those gains.” $1,500 was ALOT of money to me and my family.

Bounce off of the 1 hour 21 and continuation into the third hour of trading.  You can see how the current hourly candle wicked down and got bought up quickly.  That speaks to the strength of the buying right now.   The full range has already been played today as of this morning.  A break of 316 going into the weekend would be pretty bullish.

That's why biggest caps are doing best as well, they have been preparing 12 years for this.

The U.S. budget deficit in June was $863 billion.  For perspective, an annual budget deficit of $863 billion is enormously massive and fiscally unsustainable.  Yet, now, the U.S. government has racked up $863 billion in debt, in just one month. 
 
For additional perspective, the budget deficit for June 2019 was $8 billion.  Hence, the deficit for June 2020 has increased 101x compared to June of last year.  This, no doubt, is game over spending; desperate actions by a desperate government to keep this sucker from going down. 
 
Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital, for clarification of what’s at stake: “There’s a risk that the dollar starts to reverse into a significant downtrend because the value of the dollar versus other currencies is greatly affected by the growth in our budget and trade deficit.”

At least most Chinese will tell you to their face they think anyone other than Chinese is inferior to them and China gonna rule the world.

Global Fascist Left is most racist.  Telling black people/ ""Minorities"" they need special help to succeed is as racist as it gets.  All the while creating modern day plantations of single mothers and desolate atmosphere where kids are manipulated into believing they have no future because of the Republicans that have never had any say on any policies in their cities.

Should yield curve control go global, it would cement markets’ perception of central banks as the buyers of last resort, boosting risk appetite, lowering volatility and intensifying a broader hunt for yield. While money managers caution that such an environment could fuel reckless investment already stoked by a flood of fiscal and monetary stimulus, they nonetheless see benefits rippling across credit, equities, gold and emerging markets.

“It depends on the form and the price but broadly speaking it’s the green light to carry on with the QE trade -- buy everything regardless of valuation,” said James Athey, who manages $3.1 billion at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London.

So long as you’re trading intraday the nearest expiration option or maybe the next to nearest expiration option you have the ability to swing that contract for well over 100%+ / per Day. I want to put up a chart illustrating how at certain times of the day if you entered a particular option and yes lately it has been calls shortly after the 9:30-10:30am dip and ride those calls throughout the mid portion of the cash session you could capture 100%+ gains in a single trading session. That is how you can turn a SMALL account into $25000+ in a relatively short amount of time. Now, personally I have strict rules to my trading in terms of risk/reward, stops, and profit targets. I typically will risk SPY $0.50 or -10% on my option to make 20-40%. So my risk / reward ratios are always 1 : 2 or 1 : 4.

Berkshire H pulled out very similar to cash in Sept 2008. Hmmm.  Pretty convenient 6 months before March 2009 bottom.  What have they done in 2020.  I've listened to media call them out for missing this bull market April and May 2020. I dont expect it to last.  6 months early is a good wakeup call.

2. profit taking on tech side before earnings start (earnings starting Tues with banks)
3. algo's reset the technical indicators for the whole market (make it looks like there was an 'oversold' condition on the pullback to allow new highs)
4. Fed start another round of buying (drive down yields, increasing some rotation to safety from profit taking with bonds backed by fed - everyone wants to keep some of the money they've made)
5 . The wall of options expiring at $310 (nearly 350k+ contracts of puts and calls) - MM's price pinning

The initial theorem was that this was an accumulation cycle with a retouch on top of the breakout and turns out we were right.

Nothing shows this better than the daily. With a clear breakout from the chop and a retouch of 3105 which was top of the breakout where new demand would have to be for this to keep going, ES looks as bullish as ever. The 3180 level and of course the 3230 above are clear targets however should ES push through I don’t think either one of those levels have enough selling interest leftover to stop it. On a pullback some obvious levels to watch out for are 3150 area and 3130 area on a pullback. Until 3230 gets taken out this is still a higher low so do keep that in mind as well.

Meanwhile, if you really support BLM, check out: 1) MLK (the man), and 2) GLYC (trials with 94.5% black representation, 91% institutional ownership, sub $175M market cap, and pipeline including 2 phase 3 drugs... one of which apparently just proved statistical significance).

Another member of the coronavirus task force, Admiral Brett Giroir, added to the Fauci pile-on today when he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Fauci has not always been correct.

“I respect Dr. Fauci a lot, but Dr. Fauci is not 100 percent right and he also doesn’t necessarily, he admits that, have the whole national interest in mind. He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view,” Giroir said.

“The economic implications of the second wave are pretty clear, qualitatively at least. The third quarter recovery will be slower than we previous expected, but we're hoping that some of the deferred spending will be pushed into the fourth quarter rather than abandoned altogether,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.

“Markets are caught in the middle. We have argued for months that a full recovery depends on three pillars, namely, sustained progress against the virus, the continuance of super-accommodative Fed policy, and consistent support from fiscal policy,” he added. “Clearly, the first pillar has crumbled, and the third is now in limbo, with the Senate in recess until July 20.

L1_Trading,/L1_Trading/message/227183448,Bullish,"$SPY bears think because cases go up, death rate goes up. The most closely watched indicator during this virus is the death rate. Not the overall cases. Cases are going up and death rate is going down. This is a POSITIVE development. Also we will be getting vaccine news all week out of Russia and most likely out of the U.S also. Still haven’t gotten the point across yet? Well how about all the earnings being posted this week. Everyone will outperform a pathetic guidance and Wall Street will cheer it on. When banks lose 30% YTD it will be a massive buying opportunity because they didn’t lose 50% .... I believe the bears got their chance to pounce in March and I strongly believe that this will never go under 300.00 again, especially once this virus passes.

“Wait. I can catch Covid twice?” my 50-year-old patient asked in disbelief. It was the beginning of July, and he had just tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, for a second time — three months after a previous infection. 
 
While there’s still much we don’t understand about immunity to this new illness, a small but growing number of cases like his suggest the answer is “yes.” 
 
Covid-19 may also be much worse the second time around. During his first infection, my patient experienced a mild cough and sore throat. His second infection, in contrast, was marked by a high fever, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, resulting in multiple trips to the hospital.

This definitely has the potential to retest the 320 area later today and multiple times this week.  Seems like the buying is dying out a bit around 322 which is normal.  I am going to watch to see how the market reacts when spy comes back into the 319-321 range.   I expect to see strong buying.

“What Is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC)?

A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring an existing company. Also known as ""blank check companies,"" SPACs have been around for decades. In recent years, they've gone mainstream, attracting big-name underwriters and investors and raising a record amount of IPO money in 2019.”

I'll be watching carefully to determine when we should exit those 319 calls that expire tomorrow. Remember that if I put RISKY on a trade I'm taking two contracts at MOST. On the 319c I only took one. Please make sure that you manage your sizing and stops according to your own plan. WFC got clapped on their ER results.

4:05pm  -  I have decided to hold all 5 open positions overnight, including those $SPY calls.  I'm stepping out for a while, but will likely post some updates after 6pm ET.  I expect futures to be increasingly bullish overnight, with either a significant Gap Higher or an overall bullish day tomorrow (either scenario would fulfill the Buy Signals on my XXmin charts as of today's close).

3:58pm  -  Charts look really bullish, especially up around the XXmin time frame.

Economists expect U.S. economic growth contracted at its steepest pace in the second quarter since the Great Depression and original hopes of a swift economic bounce back have been dashed as the United States continues to struggle to contain the virus, almost five months after the first case was reported on U.S. soil.

Fed officials on Tuesday warned of ""thick fog"" ahead for the economy as they continued to reset expectations on the pace of recovery amid fears that a broad second wave of cases could causes unemployment to rise again.

The five years ended this past Thursday, up 147%. As you can see in the greet dotted double arrow line on the right of the chart that’s the gap or distance between these gains which tells us tech has a great potential for room to grow.

Paul concludes, “This is why the markets are so strong. This is why there is such a strong bid under so many stocks. It’s also why there is such a strong bid especially in America 2.0 stocks. The demand is going to be skyrocketing; whether it be electric trucks, electric cars or new energy stocks.”  banyanhill.com/2020-year-of...",2020/07/15,21:02:14

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit.

Poor bears. We didn't get the sub 27 VIX that i had hoped for, but today was another big day nonetheless (hopefully for everybody). Today we added +25% NAV to the trading account since inception on 6/1.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit.

Fauci said to The Atlantic that the “bizarre” recent efforts from White House officials to discredit him ultimately harm President Donald Trump.
Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, also included some harsh words for Trump’s trade advisor: “I can’t explain Peter Navarro; he’s in a world by himself. So I don’t even want to go there.”",2020/07/16,01:44:33

Poor bears. We didn't get the sub 27 VIX that i had hoped for, but today was another big day nonetheless (hopefully for everybody). Today we added +25% NAV to the trading account since inception on 6/1.

Me: Harvard grad and full time portfolio manager and trader w/ 10+ yrs exp. I retired from my full time gig after paying off all of my UG/Grad loans at 31 from trading and investing income. I funded a $40k account with the intention of showing people how they could earn extra income and potentially retire early through learning how to trade properly too. I also post all of my trades so there isn't any bullshit.

The Scam
The scammer will repeatedly say things like ""Doubling money!"" until a victim comes up to them and trade. The scammer will most likely asks the victim to ""test"" them and the victim will trade a small amount of money to the scammer. The scammer then trades them double the amount, claiming it's a glitch. The victim's greed then is manipulated and trades the scammer a larger amount of cash. The scammer then logs out, or attempts to increase the victim's greed even more.

Often these scammers are trolled by other members of the community. One common troll is to trade over a very small amount of money, then claiming that they gave the wrong amount of coins back. Sometimes players may stand around mocking the way that these scammers operate, except instead say 'Halving Money!'.

The scammer will usually log out when the victim offers large amounts, usually 100,000 coins or more.",2020/07/16,13:01:49

Remember, I was 9 for 10 yesterday and had to make myself back away from trading, slow down, and keep calm.  Losing emotion and bias is the MOST IMPORTANT LESSON I have learned in 26 years of trading.

Knowing BTC so well like I do, I believe when it breaks out of this wedge, we are going UP. 

Why in the world would an asset that is now more scarce than ever, with more exposure than ever, at all time high hash rate, and the community understands it more than ever, and trusts it more than ever, and people like me are writing songs about it because we like it so much (check out my Bitcoin song by the way, its on Spotify)... why in the world would that type of asset go down? 

So, yeah it's been stuck in a wedge. Big whoop. A little boring and testing on your patience, yes. 

However, when this wedge goes bye bye and it finally starts doing something different .... we are in for a MOTHER FREAKING SHOW!@

we had the VIX sub 27 print with a quick rebound. Yesterday i had called for a print range 27-31, but really didn't expect this little hedging, thus i was expecting VIX to print ~30 or certainly higher than 29 but it didnt hah. Not sure what to make of that but i guess everyone reduced risk yesterday as well!

📈 Ticker: CAT
-
CAT has been making a strong push up over the past few days. It just recently broke above the ascending triangle and holding. Once this gets above and holds our breakout at $139.94, CAT will continue towards our 1st price target at $146. If it gets above $146 and holds, then it will go to our 2nd price target  at $150.74. Earnings is on the 31st, I’d recommend selling all positions beforehand.

S&P 500 futures (ES) had a narrow range on yesterday with no commitment to either direction. That was accompanied by lower volume. S&P 500 still stays above the axis line at 3180, suggests a possibility to have a rally to test the swing high resistance at 3230.

Bias — bullish (Day trading); bullish (long term)

Key levels — Resistance: 3230, 3310; Support: 3170–3180, 3105, 3060–3080

Tesla is nearing the brink of eligibility to join the S&P 500 ... And would be one of the largest companies in the index itself should it post a quarterly GAAP profit and then be included into the index ... positivity from Tesla not just posting a quarterly profit and earning eligibility for the S&P but related index funds like $SPY now being able to initiate positions in Tesla would add value to shares ... a disastrous end for shorts ... with hugely positive events potentially just around the corner .. 🔋🚘🔋👀  $PAAS $ICVT $TAL $PSLV,2020/07/17,19:10:04

👉 Jeremy, one of the biggest Tesla Pumpers said, ""If you're buying the stock at $1500, you better be confident in 3 things"". 
Now only 2.5% of world car sales are EV vehicles.

1. ""All cars sold in 10 years will be EVs"".
🤦🏻‍♀️  In Asia or other side countries, more than 95% of homes don't have the concept of garage to charge at night.

2. ""Tesla should be No.1 or 2 player & dominant market share in US & EU & China: 25-50% market share.""
🤦🏻‍♀️  There are still consumer preference & brand royalty over BMW, Audi, Mercedez, Toyota, AND strong demands for affordable EVs in Asia and other continents. 

3.  ""Tesla should be No.1 or No.2 autonomous player in Long term""
🤦🏻‍♀️  People are already locked in iOS and Android(device, car, IoT). They're already working on it. What makes you think Tesla win against tech giants?

Institutions are hedged to the teeth through the end of the year and don't care where we land it seems. The biggest tell will be the selling from tech over the next few weeks. I don't imagine ER performance will matter much considering their best stock performance has occurred in a recession.

However, i'm sure the beats and misses from these tech companies will offer good talking points as people try to grasp the justification of these prices due to the lack of fundamentals being displayed in stock performance.

I only cite these things to show you that in America the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us.”

     You’re cocky as hell, can be a tad exhausting, but credit is due where deserved. 

  Own your shares, learn to put them to work, you accidentally lose some? Cool, sell puts till you get them back then sell calls. Rinse, repeat, rinse , repeat

Occasionally you sell calls several times before getting those shares back, but the price paid of those shares matters little in the longest game.

As denoted in the 3 circles every time this line gets passed the market pulls back up.down into it to test it as a new buyer’s or a seller’s zone. As of right now this line has been successfully tested as a new buyers zone and for this week it is sitting at 3120. This is for now the ballpark bull/bear level that we will be looking at to see if there are any new developments and if the market shows any kind of weakness/strength. 

Sitting where it is now it is well above the current conditions for market going bull however there was some obvious exhaustion in the latter part of last week we must keep in mind. The previous high in the supply was sitting at 3231 and it was raided by a few points on 7/15, but for further bullish action we would like to see that level completely taken out and held as a buyer’s zone.",2020/07/19,23:52:26

Facebook has been showing Divergence on RSI since early June.  The divergence between Price action and Momentum has continued to grow for over 6 weeks.  I think the next break of the 1D 21 here will likely lead to a very nice short.  Timing something like this can be very hard.  I do think Facebook has a 10-20% pull back before end of year which will probably lead to a very good buy opportunity.

Intel finding support over the 57.66 horizontal and 1D 200 (purple line) which shows support.  As long as INTC is able to hold above 57.66 I remain bullish on this one.  I expect a run into earnings this week potentially up to $65.

BA ended the week at a low which is never a good thing.  Lost the 1D 21 and 55 as support (yellow and green lines).  1D RSI and Stochastic's looking to cross down.  

Overall I think BA tests the 150 area one more time before heading higher. I am not sure when that happens, but I would not be buying here as things look pretty bad.

Rejection from the top of the channel on wednesday last week has lead to some nice downside.  Today's Price action opened under the 1D 55 tested it and sold off.  This is a pretty bearish sign that Price action was rejected by the 1D 55.  With 1D RSI and stochastic's in a bearish posture I think this could potentially have more downside in its future. 

A retest of the low 90's seems very likely in the next month.

Big break through resistance today at 56.  AMD has been playing around this resistance for a few weeks now and today broke clear through.  I do expect to see price action come down and test the 56 area, but for it to act as support on the next test.  A test of 56 will be a big buy area in my opinion.

Amazon with a huge bounce off of the 1D 21 last Thursday.  Amazon is up almost 10% since the retest of the 1D 21.  I believe this will likely run into earnings later this week so there is not to much analysis to be done until after earnings.  I am not buying at these prices, but I certainly wouldnt short here either.  I think patience is the best play until something more obvious is available.

With RSI and Stochastic's high in the range and starting to pull back.  This looks likely to come back to test the mid 120's.   The horizontal resistance at 132 held down price action.

The gaps on BABA these last couple of weeks make for a very interesting chart.  It is interesting that there are big moves after hours, but the trading during the day is a much smaller range.  I don't really have a strong opinion on BABA, but overall it looks strong. I think overtime BABA will come down and test the 230's and that will be a great long term buy opportunity.

Disney was rejected by the 1D 200 (purple line) last week after making a nice run.  Typically a rejection from the 1D 200 is a pretty bearish signal.  Disney did find support on the 1D 21 today, but closed the day under the 118$ horizontal.  With RSI and Stochastic's crossing down high in the range and in a bearish posture this could have some more downside.   If Disney is unable to break up above 118 I could see this down to the 111-114 area in the next couple of weeks.

Similar story to a lot of other big tech stocks.  After a pull back last week to the 1D 21 Paypal had a huge bounce today. This is a very bullish thing to see.  

Stocks are always going to go up some days and down some days, but when a bullish stock goes down you want to see it find support.  This is exactly what Paypal has done at the 1D 21.   As long as Paypal stays above the 1D 21 I am bullish on this stock.

Futures breaking through resistance at 3262 last night.  This area hasn't be tested since the high's in Jan/Feb earlier this year.  I do expect Price action to come down and test this area at some point today.  If the same bullish buying continues today I would expect a retest at the 3262 horizontal to get bought up very quickly.

Futures finding support on the 3262 horizontal.  Its amazing because this horizontal hasn't been in play since Jan/ Feb of this year, but clearly the algo's are trading it.

Cisco broke up above the 46 resistance a few weeks ago, but then was sold off.  Only to test the 1D 200 and bounce back above $46.  This 46 horizontal is extremely important as it has been in play for over 20 years.  Yes that is right Cisco has been respecting the $46 area for 20 years.  Usually a break of 46 leads to some big upside or downside.  consolidating above $46 is a great sign that should lead to some massive upside.

Twitter playing off of the horizontals beautifully this week.  I missed the short opportunity this morning off of the 38.50 resistance.  If you look at yesterdays analysis you will see that 38.5 was this weeks target and it already hit!  Overall Twitter still looks very strong so if it is able to hold above 36 this will probably be a great buy.

That paper they print is meant to prop up demand until people can go back to work and earn a wage. The problem is demand isnt being stifled because people dont want to spend money but because they physically cant due to barriers and restrictions imposed by this virus, therefore there is a gap that all the FED money in the world cant fill. In the meantime the FED will have to keep providing loans to businesses to make up for that gap in demand. Companies can only take on so much debt before paying it back becomes unrealistic and they decide bankruptcy is the only option. Every time a company goes bankrupt Jobs vanish and dont come back for a very very long time creating real long lasting holes in demand. We are racing the clock. Any indication that employment wont return to former levels quickly will send this market spiralling. Which *spoiler alert* it wont.  Data will show this in time",2020/07/23,20:13:37

I hate waiting for take off, but it's also a god send since I've been able to add 100's of calls in the meantime :D

-Merger finalization
-ER with record user growth and updated guidance and financials
-Tyson and Eros Innovations news :O
-Turning on the ads to substantially boost revenue (100s of millions of users x ad revenue = lots of $)

driving a liddle white ball 900 ft.
According to Golf Digest, Tiger 
hits drives an average of 285 yards.
His long irons (2- to 4-iron) range 
from 250 to 200 yards.
His middle irons (5, 6, 7) range 
from 208 to 172 yards. 
His 8-iron travels 158 yards,

The problems with the market right now are valuations and uncertanties. 
 
Valuation: 
 
Amazon trading over 100 P/E means even if they quadriple earnings (go up 400%) it would still take 25 years for you to get your money back! So in a best case scenario where its eps grow 30% per year, it would takr more than 5 years just to have a 25 P/E its insane... Specially that when things go back to normal next year is hard to think people will spend the same amount online as today since everyone is dying to get out. 
 
Uncertanties: 
 
Election is a big problem, because if Biden wins there will be a lot of policy changes, specially breaking up big tech, higher taxes and costly environmental laws.

For the last week the blue box area (that can be seen in the screen shot ) has been an area of very strong buying.  Today has been no difference as we can see on the first hour of trading the 319-320 area had very strong buys.   I think there is a possibility we retest that area today, but also a possibility for 323 today.   My point is not to get to bearish here as things may bounce a bit. Below 319 and the market starts to look a lot weaker.  Overall I am bearish, but with caution.

1. They dont have to be better than CCXI at all as they treat different diseases, use a diffent form of application. CCXI didnt partner with Merck to help reduce lesions from skin cancer, IFRX did. 
 
2. It is not a covid vaccine nor just used for Covid. Its treatment cures the pneumonia caused by covid which is the main cause of death. But it can be used to treat any immflamatory lung condition. Every year there will be some type of Influenza, SARS and etc. Its being tested on Covid patients now because of the urgency. But check how many people die per year because of lung complications in the hospitals even before covid. 
 
3. its being tested for at least another 3 diseases and its partner Staidson is very successful with many drugs in the market.

Death troll surged all time high. It should ring the bell what that means to US corporations and their global consumers.

Like I always said we seen infection rate kept increasing, mortality rate will also increase in next 1-3 months. 

Meanwhile, we got BS vaccines at trial state.
FDA approval requires 3,000 human testing, and another 3-8 months of follow up modification alone. 

Meanwhile, unemployment will spike, consumers purchase power will be drastically weakened. companies sale will be declined.

That's the forward thinking investment, not some hopium by Pumpers or bag holders.

Spy futures are closed for the week. On the 4 hour chart the day ending with two doji candles low in the weeks trading range.  Definitely a decent pull back this week, but no where near enough downside to confirm any sort of sell off.  We have seen massive buying in the 319 area for the last week and that continued today.  I will be watching the 319 area next week to see if it holds or breaks down.

Spy futures still well above the 1D 21 which indicates the bullishness of this market.  My target for next week is to see a retest of the 1D 21 at some point during the week.  The way that price action reacts at the 1D 21 will be very telling in regards to the bullishness / bearishness of the market.  With 1D RSI and Stochastic's crossed down I expect to see some follow through to the downside next week.

You can give people all of the money in the world and it will do them no good if they cant get into these stores to spend them. All of the lines, the social distancing, the fear that has been instilled in people, all of these things brought about by the virus is creating holes in demand that are not close-able. This lack of demand, along with supply issues, and the steady stream of debt companies have been taking on is killing their bottom line and forcing Employers to rehire people at shit wages. Between living off FED money and taking shitty low paying jobs the choice is obvious for any rational  person. FED will have to cut employment benefits to push people back to work which will cause an influx of workers looking for w.e work they can find further driving down wages. How people dont seem to grasp how fucked we are is mind numbing.

Fundy_OracleOfAlpha,/Fundy_OracleOfAlpha/message/230813618,Bearish,"@Diavolo Fed is loans, not free money. Free money is stimulus and that's ending in August, along with eviction protections. While the Fed can certainly keep struggling businesses alive in the short term through loan facilities, they can't prevent insolvency. We have already seen this with several big names such as JC Penny and Hertz, neither of which qualified due to not being investment grade, although there are others that did qualify and have since gone bankrupt, there's going to be lots of defaults on these Fed loans over the next several years. There's also a political and economic debate as to how much to lower the standards, Powell wanting it much more accessible and Mnuchin wanting stricter standards. Also see my earlier post below where I suggest $SPY can't sustain itself for another month, although of course there's no way to time it, and there could be any number of major events that change this, it seems unlikely.

THE IMF AND JOBLESS BOTH COME OUT ON THURSDAY.  THERE WILL BE A HIGHER JOBLESS NUMBER AND A REVISED IMF NUMBER POTENTIALLY IN THE -12% GDP LOSS RANGE.

Honestly people (bulls) you need to buckle up and put on your helmet.

You have Geopolitical tensions with china that are majorly out of control.  Your 2 biggest market drivers reporting earnings with every other one getting DUMPED 5-10% immediate after earnings regardless of what they do and most importantly  currency that has hit a lower low $DXY than it did in February during the dump and hit it's high after stimulus. 

There 0% chance the senate does anything more than extend the UE benefits and blames a no deal on the house.  Our markets are out of control and they know it.

1. they've been overly negative on the unemployment check talks lately but imo with the virus getting worse and reopenings continue to roll back, not to mention the Dems wanting to continue $600 for rest of the year, I could see this easily surprising to the upside on some lowering the bar in the media nonsense only to bring out the bag for a big market pop.  obv this is still problematic long-term and for the eventual inflation

2. i could actually see the GDP number surprising to the upside given how bad the number is and given how many economic numbers were blowing away forecasts up until July - and July's shutdown/reemergence of the virus won't be reflected in Q2 numbers.

This rising pattern never looked right to me upon breaking out.

Now that we have a divergence, my current bias until proven otherwise is the move up to 3284 was a false breakout or an overshoot of the pattern.

What I'm looking for next is ES to continue to consolidate inside the pattern as shown before truly breaking out. (note**usually when price overshoots a pattern in one direction, it also overshoots to the same degree in the opposite direction)

Which way will the breakout be, you ask?

Frankly, I don't see ES failing to fill the gap at 3311 and at least retesting the all time high before whatever it's gonna do beyond that.",2020/07/25,19:37:46

It's disappointing because Amazon used to be synonymous with the lowest prices and the fastest shipping, but that is simply no longer the case. I can wait an extra day or two for shipping if the item is 5% cheaper. You are basically paying for shipping with Amazon, but they add it to the price so they can call it free shipping.

* FALL of USA *
USA has Fallen to it's own Self Defeating Prophecy trying in vain to prevent it.

This problem would be easy for me to fix but not for the current USA System because it is broken. It is not Trump's fault. It won't be Biden's fault too. It wasn't Obama's etc.

The fault lies with EXCESSIVELY GREEDY PEOPLE pulling the strings of INIQUITY & INJUSTICE.

Things will only get worse & not better, unless the System is Fixed -- Limit Capitalism to $1 Billion Per Person for example. The NWO Golden Age System will fix all problems on Earth. 

Have no fear, for all of the Best USA Qualities will be implemented into the NWO.

China will also be Divided & Conquered. 😈🌹⚔️💪🍻

BUT no CULTURE, FLAGS, HISTORY etc will be changed or deleted with some NWO brand like EXTRINITI. That would be a waste of time & inefficient to our main goals (read Golden Age for details). LMFAO. 🤣🤣🤣🤣

TRUTH will always defeat LIES.

However, price went way below the 89 ema in 2008-9.  Something similar is likely to occur this time.

Notice the stochastic reading is currently having a bear cross and the three times price has hit the 89 ema in the last 5 years.  Also, notice the spread from price to the 89 ema is as wide as it's ever been.",2020/07/25,22:07:01

Hello:

Looking at SPX for sell opportunities.

We see most of the indices took a hit last week, and could have bearish continuation run in the up coming weeks.

I do like the price action and structure on SPX here. Price hit a double tops, and the top of the channel structure.

We then see a lower time frame bearish move down, now I like to see a continuation correction to form here to take it down to the bottom of the channel, and see what price will do at that area.

Thank you",2020/07/26,00:15:25

The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum shifted to the downside with the formation of the closing price reversal top on July 23 and its subsequent confirmation on Friday.
A trade through 3284.50 will negate the closing price reversal top and signal a resumption of the uptrend. The main trend changes to down on a move through the last main bottom at 3105.25.
The minor trend is also down. This confirms the shift in momentum.
The minor range is 3188.50 to 3284.50. Its 50% level at 3236.50 is resistance.
The short-term range is 3105.25 to 3284.50. Its retracement zone at 3194.75 to 3173.75 is potential support.
A second short-term range is 2983.50 to 3284.50. Its retracement zone at 3134.00 to 3098.50 is another potential support area.

Since investors have been buying breaks into retracement zones, we’re going to be watching the price action and order flow at 3194.75 to 3173.75 early Monday.
If 3173.75 fails to hold then our next downside target zone becomes 3134.00 to 3098.50. This zone is most important because it is the last potential support zone before the main bottom at 3105.25. Buyers are likely to come in to defend the trend on a test of this zone.
If 3098.50 fails then look out to the downside. The next major support comes in at 2983.50.📉📉📉📉

Are U.S. taxpayers paying twice for remdesivir because the U.S. government has already invested in its development?

No. Gilead scientists invented remdesivir with research that started more than a decade ago. Our scientists identified its broad-spectrum antiviral activity, optimized the formulation of the product and scaled up the manufacturing process. Our research and development are fundamental to remdesivir’s use to treat COVID-19, and our investment in the research and development of remdesivir is significantly greater than investment from public sources. 

To provide context, government grants for collaborative research into coronaviruses was less than two percent of the investment Gilead expects to make specifically in remdesivir this year alone.

The $76 million figure that has been quoted publicly relates to the total amount of government grants given to Gilead’s academic collaborators for their research across many disease areas.",2020/07/27,02:24:22

Futures have bounced up to the 1D 55 (green line).  On the 4 hour chart it does look as more upside is likely.  Though it is interested that the previous 4 hour candle was not able to break over the 4 hour 55 and the current candle opened up right under.  My overall target on this bounce would be to the 4 hour 21 (yellow line) that is coming in at 3230.

Are U.S. taxpayers paying twice for remdesivir because the U.S. government has already invested in its development? 
 
No. Gilead scientists invented remdesivir with research that started more than a decade ago. Our scientists identified its broad-spectrum antiviral activity, optimized the formulation of the product and scaled up the manufacturing process. Our research and development are fundamental to remdesivir’s use to treat COVID-19, and our investment in the research and development of remdesivir is significantly greater than investment from public sources.  
 
To provide context, government grants for collaborative research into coronaviruses was less than two percent of the investment Gilead expects to make specifically in remdesivir this year alone. 
 
The $76 million figure that has been quoted publicly relates to the total amount of government grants given to Gilead’s academic collaborators for their research across many disease areas.",2020/07/27,11:47:33

NEWS: Boeing preps for next test of US Navy’s future aerial tanker drone

Sat July 25

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy’s aircraft carrier-borne tanker drone, the MQ-25 Stingray, is preparing to head into the fall resuming test flights, this time with the crucial fuel store pod attached

The store pod — the same one integrated into the Navy’s stalwart F/A-18 Super Hornet for aerial refueling — was recently integrated into the MQ-25 test article under the wing

“When we resume flight testing later this year, we’ll have the opportunity to gather test points about the aerodynamics of that pod and the software commands that control it — all happening well before we deliver the Navy’s first MQ-25 jet with the same pod,” MQ-25 program director Dave Bujold said in a statement from the aircraft’s manufacturer, Boeing

“That early testing and early software development is a big part of supporting the Navy’s goal to get MQ-25 to the fleet as quickly as possible,” he added",2020/07/27,13:40:23

youtube.com/watch?v=W6S_izL...

S&P 500 futures (ES) had two bearish bars on last Thursday and Friday, with the close near the low of the price range. It looks bearish at first glance yet with simple volume spread analysis (VSA) by comparing the bar on Thursday and Friday, we can spot the presence of demand on Friday’s bar because with increasing supply level, the price spread is smaller with a demand tail. Shortening of the downward thrust was also seen in hourly (H1) chart.

Bias — bullish (Day trading); bullish (long term)

Key levels — Resistance: 3230, 3260, 3310–3340; Support: 3190, 3170–3180, 3105

Potential setup — Look for long entry after a test of 3190.",2020/07/27,14:38:39

Beleaguered company makes Robinhood List of 100 most pop stocks - should you buy in?
 
The Robinhood app kicked off a race to zero commissions & quickly built a loyal following - grown from 1M to 13M & rising!
 
""100 Most Popular"" is based on users who hold stock. The list has an intriguing, beaten-down company that could be ripe for a comeback

Fly with Boeing
Despite covid, Boeing's order backlog stands @ ~3,000 planes. The global duopoly with Airbus ultimately gives Boeing enviable demand inelasticity. Competition simply cannot go anywhere else. Airlines will stay in line for their Boeing orders to avoid running into shortages as the industry recovers
 
The FAA finished test flights to get the MAX airbound & the company expects same by the end of 2020. TSA data remains off pre-pandemic levels but travel has risen materially from 100k daily passengers in April to 700k by July

I think selling a daily call on the $SPX  is a prudent move.
Fairly strong resistance on my chart and as I said we can see 
around a 40 point drop which would lend itself delightfully to selling daily calls.
You can also sell weekly $SPX  calls and close for profit when the index hits around 3200.

Q2 Defense up nearly ~20%

Keeping up with its usual trend, the aerospace giant clinched a handful of multi-million dollar contracts during the second quarter as well. Some of these contract wins include a $2.6 billion deal for delivering 650 SLAM ER missiles as well as 402 Block II missiles and support equipment to Saudi Arabia. The jet maker also won a $439 million deal to develop new Apache AH-64E aircraft and Longbow crew trainers to the Moroccan army. These should duly get reflected in the upcoming results in the form  of backlog growth.

Will Impressive Deliveries Aid?
Boeing’s second-quarter 2020 defense delivery figures reflected a notable increase of 18.9% from the year-ago period.

TOKYO -- Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on Friday unveiled the first group of Japanese companies to subsidize for shifting manufacturing out of China to Southeast Asia or Japan.

Eighty-seven companies or groups will receive a total of 70 billion yen ($653 million) to move production lines, in a bid to reduce Japan's reliance on its large neighbor and build resilient supply chains.

Thirty of these will shift production to Southeast Asia, including Hoya, which produces hard-drive parts and will move to Vietnam and Laos. Sumitomo Rubber Industries will make nitrile rubber gloves in Malaysia, while Shin-Etsu Chemical will shift production of rare-earth magnets to Vietnam.

The other 57 projects will head to Japan.

We are far away from even thinking about unwinding any of this and all the stimulus we can give is still extremely necessary.
